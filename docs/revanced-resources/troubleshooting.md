# Troubleshooting

This is a collection of common errors and fixes.

## 4 YouTube Audio track menu is missing

Change to iPadOS in `Settings > ReVanced > Miscellaneous > Spoof video streams`.

If iPadOS does not work or buffers at 1 minute, then there currently is no solution.

## 5 Videos play with auto-dubbed audio translations

Repatch YouTube if your settings about screen does not show patches version 5.43.0 or higher.

Then enable `Settings > ReVanced > Video > Force original audio language`

If the spoof clients Android VR and visionOS do not work (Stats for nerds always shows "Android Studio"), then the original audio cannot be forced and currently there is no solution.

## 7 Stable volume is not available

Stable volume is not available when using Spoof video streams.

## 8 Childrens/music videos do not play and an error is shown

A YouTube account is required to play most childrens videos.  Ensure you are logged into a YouTube account and incognito mode is not enabled.

## 15 App shows "No internet connection"

This issue can happen after making changes to your Google account. Re-login into microG GmsCore, or uninstall then reinstall microG.

## 16 How to use the ReVanced Manager

Follow the [official](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/tree/main/docs) guide to learn how to use ReVanced Manager.

## 17 YouTube is crashing on startup or redirecting me to a page after applying patches

You might be missing [microG GmsCore](https://github.com/revanced/GmsCore/releases/latest). Install it. Or you might be patching a split APK file (refer to `16`).

## 18 YouTube Watch history is not being saved

If you use a system ad-blocker, then whitelist `s.youtube.com`.  Otherwise check your YouTube/Google account permissions and ensure your account watch history is enabled.

## 19 The first Short opened has a delay before playback starts

Showing Shorts dislikes requires fetching dislikes before the first Short starts playing.  This limitation only applies to the first Short opened and does not occur when swiping to other Shorts.

The only way to remove this delay is to turn off `Settings > ReVanced > Return YouTube Dislike > Show dislikes on Shorts`

## 20 The YouTube Shorts tab button on missing

Disable `Settings > ReVanced> General > Navigation buttons > Hide Shorts button`

## 21 ReVanced Manager is crashing/not working

ReVanced Manager is still a work in progress. Before submitting an issue, ensure it is not duplicating an existing issue.

## 22 Google login does not work

Use a username/password to log in. Some devices may require temporarily turning off 2 factor authentication.

## 23 Links don't open in a patched app

Follow [this](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6271667). The process may vary for your device. You may need to disable or uninstall the unpatched app that occupies the links to set them for the patched app.

## 27 Installation is blocked due to conflicting with an existing installation

This implies that you must remove the previous installation to solve the conflict.

This error can be caused by 'hidden' apps (Samsung Secure Folder, Android Work Profile, Xiaomi Hidden Apps, etc).  If the same app is already installed but set hidden, then it needs to be unhidden and uninstalled before the patched app can be installed.

If patching YouTube and your device is not rooted, then ensure `GmsCore support` is included during patching and no patch failures occur.

## 28 SponsorBlock does not work

The servers of SponsorBlock are likely having issues right now. Review the [current status](https://status.sponsor.ajay.app/) of SponsorBlock.

## 30 Patched app does not work with Android Auto

Enable [Android Auto developer mode](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing#developer-mode), then enable "Unknown sources" in the Android Auto developer menu.

## 32 YouTube or YouTube Music playback does not work

First ensure you are using the latest patches. You may be using outdated patches even if the app version has not changed. See [here](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-documentation/blob/main/docs/revanced-resources/questions.md#14-how-to-update-patched-apps) for additional information on updating.

Search for existing issues [here](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen) as all known issues will have an existing issue.

If videos on YouTube are instantly paused when you press the play button, then you must disable Picture in Picture due to an issue with your OS/YouTube.

## 33 Common issues during or after patching

You may have toggled settings in ReVanced Manager that are not recommended to change. Please review the warnings when adjusting these settings and reset them to their default configuration.

## 34 No ReVanced logo after patching YouTube

Enable `ReVanced settings > General > App icon`

If you do not see this option, then repatch YouTube and ensure the `Custom branding` patch is included.
